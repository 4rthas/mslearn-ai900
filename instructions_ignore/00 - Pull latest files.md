## Set up for the lab.
1.  Start Visual Studio Code by clicking on its icon in the Taskbar. When it opens, you should see the MSLEARN-AI900 project on the left-hand panel.
2.  We will pull the latest version of the project. In the open terminal type +++start setup.cmd+++ and press **enter**. This command pulls the latest version of the project to your folder. 
3.  Once the command runs, you can close the dialogue box, and close the terminal panel. Now you can begin the lab.
